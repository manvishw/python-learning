'''
Arithmetic Operators
---------------------

x + y => addition
x - u => substraction
x * y => multplication
x / y => division
x % y => modulus
x // y => floor Division
x ** y => x raise to y

'''

x = 10
y = 15

# print(x + y)
# print(x - y)
# print(x * y)
# print(x / y)
# print(x // y)
# print(x ** y)
# print(x % y)


'''
Comparison Operator
-------------------

x > y   |=> x is greater than y
x < y   |=> x is less than y
x == y  |=> x is eqaul to y
x != y  |=> x is not equal to y
x <= y  |=> x is less than equal to y
x >= y  |=> x is greater than equal to y

'''

# print(x < y)
# print(x > y)
# print(x == y)
# print(x != y)
# print(x <= y)
# print(x >= y)

'''
Logical Operators
-----------------

True and True     -> if both true then true otherwise false
True and False      -> if any one of them true then true otherwise false
not True       -> invert Like if x is True then False if false then True

'''

# print(True and False)
# print(True or False)
# print(not True)


'''
Assignment Operator
-------------------

=         -> To assgin value with-in a variable
x = 1

+=        -> Add from existing value with new value
x += 1    => x = x + 1

-=        -> Substract from existing value with new value
x -= 1    -> x = x - 1

*=        -> Multiply from existing value with new value
x *= 2    -> x = x * 2

/=        -> Division from existing value with new value
x /= 2    -> x = x / 2

'''

'''
Identity Operator
-----------------

is            -> True if both have same memory location

  ->x is y 

is not        -> True when both have different memory location

  -> x is not y

'''

# x = 10 # point 10
# y = 15
# z = 10 # point 10

# print(x is y) #False
# print(x is z) #True
# print(x is not y) #True


'''
Membership Operator
-------------------

in                 -> True if value is present in list,tuple,dict,string
not in             -> True if value is not present in list,tuple,dict,string

'''

# _str = "My name is Manas Vishwakarma"

# print("name" in _str)
# print("my" not in _str)
