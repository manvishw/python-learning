# üö® Exception Handling in Python

Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage errors in your program without breaking its execution.

## üîé Types of Errors

1. **Compile-Time Error (Syntax Error)**  
   - Occurs while writing code (invalid syntax).  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     print("Hello"  # Missing closing parenthesis
     ```

2. **Runtime Error (Exception)**  
   - Occurs during execution of the program.  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     print(5 / 0)  # ZeroDivisionError
     ```

3. **Logical Error**  
   - Program runs without crashing but produces incorrect output.  
   - Example:  
     ```python
     # Expected square but returns double
     def square(num):
         return num * 2
     ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Handling Exceptions

Python provides a **try-except-finally** block.

except ExceptionType:
    # Handle the error
finally:
    # Always executed (cleanup code like closing DB connections)
```
